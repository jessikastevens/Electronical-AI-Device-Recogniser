Power Consumption Prediction API
This is a Flask API that predicts power consumption based on real-time data. It also provides a way to get power consumption data for a specific appliance within a specified date range.

Endpoints
POST /AI: Predicts power consumption based on real-time data. The request body should be a JSON object with the following properties:

Real Power: The real power (in watts).
Reactive Power: The reactive power (in VAR).
RMS Current: The root mean square of the current (in amperes).
Frequency: The frequency (in hertz).
RMS Voltage: The root mean square of the voltage (in volts).
Phase Angle: The phase angle (in degrees).
Date: The date when the data was collected (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD").
time: The time when the data was collected (in the format "HH:MM:SS").
POST /CSV: Gets power consumption data for a specific appliance within a specified date range. The request body should be a JSON object with the following properties:

Appliance: The name of the appliance.
Begin Date: The start date of the date range (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD").
Ending Date: The end date of the date range (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD").
Running the API
To run the API, execute the following command:

The API will be available at http://localhost:5000.
