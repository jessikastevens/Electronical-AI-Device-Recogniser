# Electronical AI Device Recogniser

This project uses machine learning to identify electronic devices based on user input. It leverages three separate APIs for data collection and prediction. Each API is hosted individually, enabling efficient and accurate appliance recognition, while also allowing the user to visualize the dataset and talk with an AI assistant.

## Features
- Predicts the type of electronic device based on input data.
- Utilizes three independently hosted APIs.
- Visually displays the dataset.
- Leverages Google Gemini to assist with data analysis.

## Dataset Acknowledgement
  This project uses the ACS-F2 dataset provided by the iCoSys Institute, University of Applied Sciences HES-SO//Fribourg, Engineering and Architecture Faculty. The ACS-F2 database contains appliance consumption signatures, including real power, reactive power, RMS current, frequency, RMS   voltage, and phase of voltage relative to current, for machine learning tasks such as classification and prediction.
